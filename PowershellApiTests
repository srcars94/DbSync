1. Test HTTP to HTTPS Redirect (PowerShell)

Run this in PowerShell to see the redirect response:

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://yourdomain.com/MyApp/API/list/myendpoint" -MaximumRedirection 0 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
$response.StatusCode
$response.Headers.Location

You should see:

StatusCode = 301 or 302

Location = https://yourdomain.com/MyApp/API/list/myendpoint



---

2. Test HSTS Header (PowerShell)

This only works over HTTPS, since HSTS is sent on secure connections.

$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://yourdomain.com/MyApp/API/list/myendpoint"
$response.StatusCode
$response.Headers.'Strict-Transport-Security'

You should see:

StatusCode = 200 (or the actual API response code)

Strict-Transport-Security = max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
